# launchdns

A launchd friendly development DNS server.

```
launchdns [-spt46]
```


## Installation

```
$ make
$ make install [PREFIX=<prefix>]
````


## Usage

Start DNS server on port 55353.

```
$ launchdns -p 55353
```


## Options

* `-s <name>`, `--socket=<name>`

Name of key in Launchd Sockets dictionary to bind to. If name is set, the `--port` option is ignored.

* `-p <num>`, `--port=<num>`

Port number to bind to. Defaults to 55353.

* `-t <num>`, `--timeout=<num>`

Number of seconds to run for. Will run indefinitely by default.

* `-4 <addr>`, `--a=<addr>`

IPv4 address for all A responses. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.

* `-6 <addr>`, `--aaaa=<addr>`

IPv6 address for all AAAA responses. Defaults to ::1.


## Launch Agent configuration

The most basic setup is running an agent that binds to the default port.

**~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.josh.launchdns.plist**

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>com.github.josh.launchdns</string>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/usr/local/bin/launchdns</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

This will keep `launchdns` running on port 55353 anytime you log into your computer.

Though, the preferred way to configure the server is to run on demand.

**~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.josh.launchdns.plist**

```php
{
    Label = "com.github.josh.launchdns";
    ProgramArguments =     (
        "/usr/local/bin/launchdns",
        "--socket=Listeners",
        "--timeout=30"
    );
    Sockets =     {
        Listeners =         {
            SockNodeName = "127.0.0.1";
            SockServiceName = 55353;
            SockType = dgram;
        };
    };
}
```

Instead of the server being started at load, it will automatically start on demand when theres activity on 127.0.0.1:55353. And after 30 seconds, it will quit until it needs to be launched again. Note the `--socket` name matches the `Listeners` name of the Socket dictionary key.

Last, configure your system's resolver to use the nameserver for whatever TLDs you wish, for an example `.dev`.

**/etc/resolver/dev**

```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 55353
```
